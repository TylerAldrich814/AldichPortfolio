# Cellphone Size:
  * Show Code
    - Change Filename size( too large )
    - Weird shake when file is long and requires scrolling(?)
      not sure If I'll be able to fix this since react-code-blocks
      is a 3rd party library...
    - Directory is too long( shoots past the bottom of the code-continer)


# Need to re-setup 'Get in touch field' with Fiebase Functions.
